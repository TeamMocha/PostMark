# PostMark
A small Node.js program to convert Postman collections to Markdown friendly syntax. PostMark takes a collection of API routes from Postman and converts it into Markdown friendly syntax ready to be added to a GitHub README.md file. For our first stage we are using GitHub Flavored Markdown, hopefully adding others if time permits.

Since documentation is incredibly important when hosting a project on GitHub we believe that this will help developers very easily show the routes used in their APIs. This should save the developer time, make using a project easier for users and improve readability of documentation.
